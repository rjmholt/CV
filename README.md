# CV

This repo contains my curriculum vitae (CV), otherwise known as a resum√©.

The canonical form is the JSON file, following the [JSON resume specification](https://jsonresume.org/).

Other forms are built from that file.

You can view this CV in rendered form [here](https://registry.jsonresume.org/rjmholt).
