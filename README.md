# CV

This repo contains my curriculum vitae (CV), otherwise known as a resum√©.

The canonical form is the JSON file, following the [JSON resume specification](https://jsonresume.org/),
and other forms are built from that file.

You can view this CV in rendered form [here](https://registry.jsonresume.org/rjmholt).

PDF and HTML artefacts are generated by CI, so you can find the latest CV in each format from CI in `main`.
